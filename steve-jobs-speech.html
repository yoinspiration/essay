        And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition
        turned out to be priceless later on.

        So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
        You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,
        whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road
        will give you the confidence to follow your heart. Even when it leads
        you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.
      </p>

        I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from
        the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me, I still loved what
        I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had
        been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.
      </p>

        Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m
        convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I
        did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work
        as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of
        your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you
        believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what
        you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with
        all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And like any
        great relationship, it just gets better as the years roll on. So keep
        looking. Don’t settle.

        If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most
        certainly be right. （双关）
      </p>
      <p>
        Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever
        encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost
        everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
        embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of
        death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
        going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
        have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to
        follow your heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And
        that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best
        invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to
        make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long
        from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry
        to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

          >Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
          Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other
          people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
          your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
          your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly
          want to become. Everything else is secondary.</strong
