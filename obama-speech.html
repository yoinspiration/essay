        Every single one of you has something that you’re good at. Every single
        one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to
        yourself to discover what that is. That’s the opportunity an education
        can provide. Maybe you could be a great writer — maybe even good enough
        to write a book or articles in a newspaper — but you might not know it
        until you write that English paper — that English class paper that’s
        assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor — maybe
        even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or
        vaccine — but you might not know it until you do your project for your
        science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a Supreme
        Court justice — but you might not know that until you join student
        government or the debate team. And no matter what you want to do with
        your life, I guarantee that you’ll need an education to do it. You want
        to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a
        nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You’re
        going to need a good education for every single one of those careers.
        <strong
          >You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.</strong
        >
        You’ve got to train for it and work for it and learn for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in
        science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop
        new energy technologies and protect our environment. You’ll need the
        insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social
        studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and
        make our nation more fair and more free. You’ll need the creativity and
        ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that
        will create new jobs and boost our economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you are right now doesn’t have to determine where you’ll end up.
        No one’s written your destiny for you. You write your own destiny. You
        make your own future. <span class="text-xl">(我命由我不由天）</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Set your own goals for your education — and do everything you can to
        meet them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying
        attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to
        really work at it. I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that
        you can be rich and successful without any hard work — that your ticket
        to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star.
        Chances are you’re not going to be any of those things. The truth is,
        being successful is hard. You won’t love every subject that you study.
        You won’t click with every teacher that you have. Not every homework
        assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this
        minute. And you won’t necessarily succeed at everything the first time
        you try. That’s okay. Some of the most successful people in the world
        are the ones who’ve had the most failures. J.K. Rowling’s — who wrote
        Harry Potter — her first Harry Potter book was rejected 12 times before
        it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school
        basketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots
        during his career. But he once said, “ I have failed over and over and
        over again in my life. And that’s why I succeed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        These people succeeded because they understood that you can’t let your
        failures define you — you have to let your failures teach you. You have
        to let them show you what to do differently the next time. So if you get
        into trouble, that doesn’t mean you’re a troublemaker, it means you need
        to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn’t mean
        you’re stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying. No
        one’s born being good at all things. You become good at things through
        hard work. You’re not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new
        sport. You don’t hit every note the first time you sing a song. You’ve
        got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You
        might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You
        might have to read something a few times before you understand it. You
        definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it’s good enough to
        hand in. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for
        help when you need it. I do that every day.
        <strong
          >Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength
          because it shows you have the courage to admit when you don’t know
          something, and that then allows you to learn something new.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        And even when you’re struggling, even when you’re discouraged, and you
        feel like other people have given up on you, don’t ever give up on
        yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your
        country. The story of America isn’t about people who quit when things
        got tough. It’s about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved
        their country too much to do anything less than their best.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went
        on to wage a revolution and they founded this nation. Young people.
        Students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a Depression
        and won a world war, who fought for civil rights and put a man on the
        moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Google and
        Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other.
        So today, I want to ask all of you, what’s your contribution going to
        be? What problems are you going to solve? What discoveries will you
        make? What will a President who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say
        about what all of you did for this country?
