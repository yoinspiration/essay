      <p>My dear child,</p>
      <p>
        You are about to participate in the next leg of your journey through
        life. For us, this part is bittersweet. As you go off to college,
        exciting new worlds will open up to you. They will inspire and challenge
        you; you will grow in incredible ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also a moment of sadness. Your departure to college makes it
        undeniably clear that you are no longer a child. There has been no
        greater joy than watching you arrive at this moment. You have turned our
        greatest challenge into our greatest pride. Although we have brought you
        to this point, it is hard to watch you depart. Remember above all
        things, we will miss you.
      </p>
      <p>
        College will be the most important time of your life. It is here that
        you will truly discover what learning is about. You often ask, “Why do I
        need to know this?” I encourage you to stay inquisitive, but remember
        this: “Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he
        learned in school.” What you learn is not as important as the fact that
        you learn. This is the heart of scholarship:
        <strong
          >moving from teacher-taught to master-inspired, on over to the point
          where you become a self-learner. So, take each subject seriously, and
          if something doesn’t immediately engage you, don’t despair. Embrace it
          as a challenge. Find a way to make it your own.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, you must still take care to sign up for courses which
        stimulate your passion and your intellectual capacity. Don’t be bound by
        what other people think. Steve Jobs said, when you are in college, your
        passion will create many dots, and later in your life you will connect
        them. So, don’t worry too much about what job you will have; don’t be
        too practical. If you like French or Korean, study it even if someone
        else tells you that it’s not useful. Enjoy picking your “dots”. Be
        assured that one day, you will find your own meaningful career, and you
        will connect a beautiful curve through those dots.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know that we always want to do your best, but don’t let the pressure
        of grades get to you. We care only that you try your very best, and that
        you learn.
        <strong
          >It is better that your greatest effort earns a lesser grade than that
          no effort earns you a decent or higher grade.</strong
        >
        Grades in the end are simply letters fit to give the vain something to
        boast about, and the lazy something to fear. You are too good to be
        either. <strong>The reward is not the grade but what you learn.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More importantly, make friends and trust others.</strong> The
        friends you make in college can be the best ones you will ever have.
        During these years, when you move into adulthood, the friends you make
        in college live closer to you than your family. You will form bonds of
        friendship that will blossom over many decades.
        <strong
          >Pick friends who are genuine and sincere. Select a few and become
          truly close to them. Don’t worry about their hobbies, grades, or
          looks. Instead, trust your instincts when you make new
          friends.</strong
        >
        You are a genuine and sincere person; anyone would enjoy your
        friendship. So be confident, secure, and proactive. If you think you
        like someone, tell them. You have very little to lose. Don’t be afraid
        to trust. Give others the benefit of the doubt, and don’t reduce anyone
        to stereotypes.
        <strong
          >Nobody is perfect; as long as others are genuine, trust them and be
          good to them. They will give back.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Remember also that your youth is full of strength and beauty,
          something that you will not comprehend until it is gone. You must
          guard and cultivate your strength and beauty. A healthy body and a
          sound mind are the greatest instruments you will ever possess. Enjoy
          life. Dance if you feel like it. Don’t be afraid of what other people
          think. But also keep yourself safe and sound. Don’t let range of new
          experiences take your innocence, health, or curiosity away from you.
          Treasure your youth and the university experience before you.</strong
