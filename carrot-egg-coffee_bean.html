        A Carrot, an Egg, and a Cup of Coffee
      </h1>
      <div class="text-2xl">
        <p>
          A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how
          things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to
          make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and
          struggling. It seemed that as one problem was solved, a new one arose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water
          and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In the
          first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the
          last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil,
          without saying a word.
        </p>
        <p>
          In about twenty minutes, she turned off the burners. She fished the
          carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and
          placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in
          a bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning to her daughter, she asked, “Tell me, what do you see?”
          “Carrots, eggs, and coffee,” the daughter replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She
          did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter
          to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed
          the hard-boiled egg. Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the
          coffee. The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter
          then asked, “What does it mean, mother?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same
          adversity—boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in
          strong, hard and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the
          boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile.
          Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after
          sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The
          ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the
          boiling water, they had changed the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Which are you?” she asked her daughter. “When adversity knocks on
          your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee
          bean?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with
          pain and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am
          I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the
          heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a
          financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and
          stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and
          tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart?
        </p>
        <p>
          Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water,
          the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot,
          it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when
          things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation
          around you. When the hour is darkest and trials are their greatest, do
          you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity?
          Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?
        </p>
        <p>
          May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make
          you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, and enough hope to make
          you happy. The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of
          everything—they just make the most of everything that comes along
          their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten
          past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past
          failures and heartaches.
