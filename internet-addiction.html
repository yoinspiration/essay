        Too much of a good thing – A real addiction
      </h1>

          Perhaps the greatest change the world has seen in modern times has
          been the rise of the Internet. It’s hard to deny the positive changes
          it adds to people’s lives as it makes life easier with quick access to
          things like maps, news, and online stores. As a research tool, it is
          unmatched
          <span class="text-xl">(无与伦比的)</span>. It’s a great way to keep up
          with friends. It enables a wealth of media outlets and alternative
          news sources.

            practically a must for success in the modern world.</strong

          Like any technology, though, it has negative aspects that become clear
          as we start to depend upon it. Like pollution and traffic jams that
          come with the convenience of cars, Internet access has proven so
          popular that it has given rise to a new kind of social epidemic,
          <strong>Internet addiction</strong>.

          Consider the following stories. A few years ago, a couple in the
          United States was charged with child neglect. It was their addiction
          to playing games online that kept them from caring for their two
          infant children. Another recent news story told of a man who spent so
          much time online that he didn’t sleep enough to keep his job.
          Eventually, he lost his house but kept his laptop and still spent all
          day online.

          College students are impacted as well. There are many stories of
          excellent students who lost their university scholarships from poor
          grades, or of other students who failed at the university altogether
          simply because they spent too much time online. One student not only
          failed, but lost 12 pounds. He was so involved online that he forgot
          to eat! Imagine the agony of this condition!

          <strong
            >These things did not happen to these people because they were lazy
            or stupid. They happened because of addiction. New college students,
            even the brightest and most successful ones, are most at risk from
            these effects because the Internet is important for their studies
            and because they are just entering a world where their online habits
            are no longer monitored by concerned parents. Without the discipline
            and structure of home, students have to manage time by themselves.
            During their very first term, their grades can plunge, their health
            decline, and their friendships cease.</strong

          It is easy for those who are unaffected by the powerful draw of
          connectivity – those who can easily control their time online – to
          view Internet addiction as an imaginary problem or to attribute its
          origins to a weak personality. But the brain chemistry behind Internet
          addiction is not imaginary. Many common Internet interactions, such as
          scoring points in online games, getting emails or instant messages,
          finding new blog entries, all cause the release of endorphins in the
          brain. Endorphins are the essential brain chemicals connected with
          positive feelings of success and pleasure. This is no surprise,
          considering that Internet interactions often involve succeeding at a
          challenge or having social exchanges. Our brains reward us for these
          activities in real life all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trouble with the Internet is that it makes it possible to have
          unnaturally long periods of endorphin release, sustained rewards from
          the brain that are as quick as the click of a mouse. These rewards are
          not actual, useful, real-life rewards, but simple stimulation that
          arouses positive feedback in the brain. In real life endorphins
          encourage us to interact with friends or family, or attempt to learn
          something new. With Internet addiction endorphins do nothing but keep
          people hooked to their computers.
          <strong
            >Internet addicts behave very much like gamblers pulling the lever
            at machines in Las Vegas, even if it is not rational, hurts their
            studies, or spoils their health and their lives.</strong

          <strong
            >So watch how much time you spend online; moderation is your best
            defense against Internet addiction. Use the wonders of connectivity
            to enrich your studies, stay connected with distant friends and
            explore multiple new worlds. Just be careful. Notice if you find you
            are thinking about the Internet even when you’re not online, or if
            you prefer your online time to time with your real-life friends, or
            if you hide or lie about how much time you spend online. If you find
            yourself doing any of these things, take a step back. Look for other
            ways to enjoy your life. Get some exercise, which is a major source
            of endorphins! Visit a museum or a beautiful park. Get together with
            friends to study or schedule some fun time to relax. The Internet is
            a powerful tool, but make sure that you use it wisely for all the
            good value it offers and that you won’t let too much of a good thing
            become something bad.</strong
